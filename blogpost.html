        <h2 class="font1">How The Internet and Social Media Are Changing Culture</h2>
        <p class="font1">
            It is no doubt that the Internet and the social media are powerful instruments for mobilization of people. However, it is not its own technological imperative that allows the social media to play a prominent role in social protest.

            Throughout human history new technologies of communication have had a significant impact on culture. Inevitably in the early stages of their introduction the impact and the effect of such innovations were poorly understood. Plato used the voice of Socrates to raise the alarm about the perils posed by the invention of writing and of reading. In his dialogue Phaedrus, Plato denounced writing as inhuman and warned that writing weakened the mind and that it threatened to destroy people‚Äôs memory.
            
            Also the invention of the printing press was at its time perceived as a threat to European culture, social order and morality. ‚ÄúEver since they began to practice this perverse excess of printing books, the church has been greatly damaged,‚Äù lamented Francisco Penna, a Dominican defender of the Spanish Inquisition. Similar concerns have also been raised in the aftermath of the ascendancy of the electronic media‚Äîtelevision in particular has been often represented as a corrosive influence on public life.
